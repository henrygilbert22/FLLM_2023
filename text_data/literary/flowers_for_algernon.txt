I had a test today. I think I faled it. and I think that maybe now they wont use me. What happind is a nice young man was in the room and he had some white cards with ink spillled all over them. He sed Charlie what do you see on this card. I was very skared even tho I had my rabits foot in my pockit because when I was a kid I always faled tests in school and I spillled ink to.
I told him I saw a inkblot. He said yes and it made me feel good. I thot
that was all but when I got up to go he stopped me. He said now sit down
Charlie we are not thru yet. Then I dont remember so good but he wan tid me
to say what was in the ink. I dint see nuthing in the ink but he said there was
picturs there other pepul saw some picturs. I coudnt see any picturs. I reely
tryed to see. I held the card close up and then far away. Then I said if 1 had
my glases I coud see better I usally only ware my glases in the movies or TV
but 1 said they are in the closh in the hall. I got them. Then I said let me see
that card agen I bet III find it now.
