But in the end, she had to live with the persistent Misfit, an escaped federal penitentiary prisoner. Back on the road again, she talks to the children's mother about change and the burden of experience.", "break_it_down.txt": "Watching her all day long, looking at me, smiling, singing, joking, I smile back, slowly next to her. She talks, touches me, close to me. Touches and smiles add up, build up, night plans, body plans, performance, slow and easy, hold back, edge around, plunge, finish, weakness, trembling legs, small light, bathroom.", "cat_person.txt": "Flirting for tips, the barista at the movie theater doesn't get tips. Robert is cute, we talk at a party, and I have an imaginary crush on him. In a dull class, he's in his mid-20s, tall, liked, with a tattoo edging out from his rolled-up sleeve. He's on the heavy side, with a beard that's too long, and slumped shoulders as if protecting something.", "cathedral.txt": "A blind man, who was my wife's friend, came to visit after his wife died. He was visiting Connecticut relatives and took a 5-hour train to make arrangements. We met 10 years ago in Seattle and kept in touch through tapes. He was not enthusiastic about his blindness, and we talked about movies, not laughing, and seeing-eye dogs. It was uncomfortable, and I needed a job. We reminisced about our summer love, my time in officer's training, having no money, and a job ad for reading to the blind. He got hired and worked in social service. We became good friends, and on the last day, he touched my face and neck in a memorable moment. I attempted to write a poem about the important events in our lives.", "flowers_for_algernon.txt": "I attempted to study but I think I failed and now want to understand. What happened to the once young man in the room with the cards and ink spilled? He said, \"Charlie, can you see what?\" Scared, I grabbed a rabbit's foot from my pocket. The kid failed the tests and spilled ink too. I saw an inkblot. Yes, I felt good. I thought we all got up and stopped. Said not through yet. I remember wanting to see the ink. I don't see any pictures. Others can see pictures. I can't see pictures. I tried to clear up close and far. Glasses move on the TV. I closed the hall and got my glasses. I saw the card again but couldn't find anything new.", "sticks.txt": "I left home, got married, had kids, and there was meanness in us. My dad dressed the pole with complexity and less logic. For Groundhog Day, he added a light for the shadow. There was an earthquake in Chile, so he attached something to the pole's side and sprayed the rift. When my mom died, he added a symbol for death and photos of my mom with a baby. Odd talismans at the base included army medals, tickets, sweatshirts, and my mom's makeup. The pole had an autumn yellow theme and cotton swabs for winter. He placed six crossed sticks in the yard and attached string and letters of apology, error, and frantic pleas on index cards. Did he want a sign of love and forgiveness? My dad died with the hall radio on, the house was sold, and the new couple yanked the pole and sticks for garbage day.", "symbols_and_signs.txt": "For the fourth time in years, it was a birthday present for a young, deranged man who desired nothing. Man-made objects were either evil or had no use in his abstract world. He sought to eliminate gadgets and offensive, frightening items.

The village gathered in the square at 10 am, with 300 people attending the lottery, which lasted two hours before they went home for a noon dinner. The kids assembled first, as school was out, discussing their classes and teachers. Boys collected stones and piled them up, guarding their collection, while the girls talked and the small kids played. Men gathered, discussing farming and taxes, and the women joined in, greeting each other and gossiping. They called the kids, and Bobby Martin resisted at first but eventually joined his family. Mr. Summers conducted the lottery, owning a coal business and being childless, often scolding his wife. The black box arrived, placed on Mr. Graves' three-legged stool. People kept their distance as Mr. Martin and Mr. Baxter helped hold the box. Mr. Summers stirred the papers inside. The black box was old and shabby, a tradition not replaced, with its original wood faded and stained.", "the_veldt.txt": "On June 27th, during a sunny day, the villagers come together to participate in the lottery, which takes less than two hours to complete.
